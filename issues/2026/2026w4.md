# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [“Happiness is not the absence of problems, it’s the ability to deal with them.” — Steve Maraboli, Life, the Truth, and Being Free](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/320313-happiness-is-not-the-absence-of-problems-it-s-the-ability)
* [“We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.” — Kurt Vonnegut, Mother Night](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13719-we-are-what-we-pretend-to-be-so-we-must)
* “A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest people.” — Roald Dahl
* “Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be.” — Alan Watts
* [“To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.” — G.K. Chesterton](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/376714-to-love-means-loving-the-unlovable-to-forgive-means-pardoning)

# Things I Learned This Week

* [黃豆粕（ㄆㄛˋ）](https://www.google.com/search?q=黃豆粕) 是黃豆榨油後留下的副產物（豆渣），經脫脂與乾燥形成高蛋白粉，脂肪含量低、蛋白質濃度高。
* [The Omega Point](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Omega+Point), proposed by [Pierre Teilhard de Chardin](https://www.google.com/search?q=Pierre+Teilhard+de+Chardin), is a vision of the universe evolving toward a final state of maximum **complexity**, **consciousness**, and **unity**, where all intelligence converges into an ultimate form often interpreted as divine. Teilhard argues that evolution is not random but directed, progressing from matter → life → mind → a global [noosphere](https://www.google.com/search?q=noosphere) (智慧圈/人類圈) → the Omega Point. Though widely debated and scientifically controversial, the concept remains influential in discussions of spirituality, cosmology, and the future of intelligence.
* [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is an open-source standard that defines how AI models securely access external tools, data, and services through a unified client–server architecture, enabling LLMs to “plug into” systems like databases, APIs, file stores, or enterprise apps. (就像「萬國轉接插頭」)
* [蛋塔效應（Portuguese Egg Tart Effect）](https://www.google.com/search?q=蛋塔效應) 指一種「短期爆紅 + 盲目擴張 + 市場崩解」的循環現象：某產品或趨勢因快速爆紅而吸引大量跟風投入，使供給短期內急速膨脹，最終因需求退燒而迅速泡沫化，造成倒閉潮；僅有具差異化與實力的業者能存活。
* [藍氨（Blue Ammonia）](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E8%97%8D%E6%B0%A8) 是利用化石燃料製氨時，透過 CCUS（[Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage](https://www.google.com/search?q=Carbon+Capture%2C+Utilization+and+Storage)）捕捉並封存碳排的低碳氨，被視為能源轉型的過渡方案。藍氨既能作為清潔燃料，也能作為氫的載體，在電力、航運與高能耗產業中具有潛力。台積電（TSMC）已開始在其晶圓廠導入藍氨，要求上游供應鏈以低碳方式生產液氨，藉此降低氨水製程化學品的供應鏈碳足跡，初期即可減少約 60–70% 的相關排放，成為半導體業從化學品源頭推動減碳的重要案例。
