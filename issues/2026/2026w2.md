# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [“There's so much to be grateful for, words are poor things.” — Marilynne Robinson, Home](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/349991-there-s-so-much-to-be-grateful-for-words-are-poor)
* [“Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent.” — Victor Hugo](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/14451-music-expresses-that-which-cannot-be-put-into-words-and)
* On your journey through life, make sure your biography has at least one extraordinary chapter.
* Results tend to accumulate to the person who enjoys the lifestyle that precedes the result.
* “I avoid looking forward or backward, and try to keep looking upward.” — Charlotte Bronte

# Things I Learned This Week

* 高斯（G）是用來描述磁場密度或強度的單位，1 特斯拉（T）等於 10,000 高斯（G）。例如，家用磁力貼的磁場大約 0.1–0.15 T（1000–1500 G），而 MRI（核磁共振機）的磁場則強得多，約 1.5–3 T（15,000–30,000 G）。
* [**Lottie**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Lottie) is a file format for vector graphics animation. It’s an [open-source library developed by Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb) that enables the rendering of high-quality animations on mobile (iOS、Android) and web platforms in real time. Unlike traditional GIFs or video files, Lottie animations are **vector-based** and exported as **JSON files**. Lottie animations have frames, but instead of storing bitmaps like GIFs, they are **dynamically rendered** from keyframes, allowing smooth playback at any resolution. This is why Lottie files are **much smaller than GIFs or videos** while still allowing **smooth animations at any resolution**. You can also **control the frames programmatically**, e.g., jump to a specific frame, loop certain frames, or reverse the animation.
* **[LifeSaver 救命水壺](https://www.google.com/search?q=LifeSaver+救命水壺)** 由英國工程師 [Michael Pritchard](https://www.google.com/search?q=Michael+Pritchard) 在受到 2004 年南亞海嘯與卡翠娜颶風啟發所創造，是全球第一款一體成型過濾水壺，專為災區與戶外極端環境提供安全飲水而設計。它採用僅 15 奈米的超濾薄膜孔徑，遠小於一般細菌（約 200 nm）與病毒（約 25 nm），無需任何化學添加劑即可有效阻絕霍亂弧菌、H1N1 等微生物汙染源。這項技術曾登上 [TED](https://youtu.be/CYa85fcpVjY)，並延伸出大容量的 [LifeSaver Jerrycan](https://www.google.com/search?q=LifeSaver+Jerrycan) 救命水桶，能在災難救援與戶外探險中提供大量潔淨水源。其內建的 [FailSafe](https://iconlifesaver.com/pages/lifesaver-failsafe-technology) 機制會在濾心孔洞完全堵塞時自動停止出水，確保永遠不會喝到未過濾的髒水，使 LifeSaver 成為便攜、安全又高效的極端環境淨水方案。
* SPA = Salus/Sanum/Sanitas Per Aquam = “health through water” = 水療
* The [**Library of Alexandria (亞歷山大圖書館)**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Library+of+Alexandria), established in the 3rd century BCE in Egypt, was the ancient world’s preeminent center of knowledge, housing texts in literature, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine from across the Mediterranean and beyond. It attracted renowned scholars such as Euclid (數學), Archimedes (物理與工程), and Eratosthenes (地理). Its legacy profoundly influenced modern libraries, digital knowledge repositories, and interdisciplinary scholarship.
