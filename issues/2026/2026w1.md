# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “There is no coming to consciousness without pain.” — Carl Jung
* “How you think when you lose determines how long it will be until you win.” — Gilbert Chesterton → The secret to winning is learning how to lose. Your response to failure determines your capacity for success.
* “The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something.” — Barack Obama
* “To be interested in the changing seasons is a happier state of mind than to be hopelessly in love with spring.” — George Santayana
* “We should not look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors.” — George Washington

# Things I Learned This Week

* 「天絲」與「蠶絲」是兩種性質不同的材質，但因天絲光滑細緻、觸感柔軟，被稱為「平價蠶絲」。天絲來自天然木漿，屬於再生纖維，其生產過程可製成嫘縈（Viscose）、莫代爾（Modal）與萊賽爾（Lyocell）三種類型，具有涼感、透氣、不易起毛球等優點；而蠶絲則是由蠶吐出的動物性蛋白質纖維，質地輕柔親膚，天然抗過敏、調溫表現佳。整體來說，天絲更耐用與好清潔，價格也更親民；蠶絲則以奢華柔滑與貼膚感見長。
* [愛玉籽](https://www.google.com/search?q=愛玉籽) 是台灣特有植物「[愛玉藤](https://www.google.com/search?q=愛玉藤)」成熟果實中的種子，外層覆蓋天然果膠。[只要放入紗布袋中，在含有礦物質的常溫水中搓洗，在鈣、鎂離子的作用下，就能釋放果膠，靜置後會自然凝固成愛玉凍。](https://pansci.asia/archives/344457) 愛玉凍是一種低熱量、富含膳食纖維的食物，可與蜂蜜、檸檬汁等搭配食用。
* [**Vibe Coding (氛圍編碼)**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Vibe+Coding)**, coined by **[Andrej Karpathy](https://www.google.com/search?q=Andrej+Karpathy)**, is a natural-language-driven approach to programming where developers describe their intentions and let LLMs generate code, allowing them to focus on _ideas_ rather than syntax. Vibe Coding lowers the entry barrier for non-programmers and accelerates rapid prototyping / MVP development However, it comes with security issues, maintainability challenges, and technical debt, which means it must be adopted carefully.
* [**Rubik’s Cubes (魔術方塊)**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Rubik%27s+Cubes) are iconic 3D combination puzzles invented by Hungarian architect Ernő Rubik, centered on twisting layers so each face returns to a uniform color; over time, they’ve evolved from the classic **3×3×3 cube** into a wide range of twisty puzzles like the **2×2 (Pocket Cube)**, **4×4 (Rubik’s Revenge)**, **5×5 (Professor’s Cube)**, and shape-based variants such as the **Pyraminx**, **Megaminx**, **Skewb**, and **Mirror Cube**. They are widely used in STEM education, since they illustrate group theory, spatial reasoning, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking.
* [Net Promoter Score (NPS)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Net+Promoter+Score) is a metric used to measure customer loyalty by asking one core question: “How likely are you to recommend this product or service to a friend?” Respondents are categorized into Promoters (9–10), Passives (7–8), and Detractors (0–6), and the score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. The key insight is that NPS distills customer satisfaction, referral likelihood, and brand loyalty into a single indicator, making it a widely adopted tool for evaluating customer experience, identifying areas of improvement, and predicting long-term growth.
