# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* You can reinvent yourself as many times as you need. New habits. New standards. New people. New career. You're never stuck. You're allowed to change. Today, tomorrow, and as many times as it takes to create the life you want.
* [“Sometimes it takes a good fall to really know where you stand.” — Hayley Williams](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/239412-sometimes-it-takes-a-good-fall-to-really-know-where)
* [“We are all failures - at least the best of us are.” — J.M. Barrie](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/288278-we-are-all-failures--at-least-the-best-of-us)
* “You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it.” — Paulo Coelho
* “It’s not just that we need to set more flexible goals. We ourselves also need to be more flexible in the way we evaluate success and failure.” ― Annie Duke, Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away

# Things I Learned This Week

* [Polaroids](https://www.google.com/search?q=Polaroids)（寶麗來/拍立得相機）的最大特色是拍照後能立即輸出即影即有膠片（Instant Film），讓影像在幾分鐘內顯現。由愛德溫·蘭德（Edwin H. Land） 於 1948 年推出第一款 Model 95 開始，Polaroid 經歷了 peel-apart film 與更便利的 integral film 技術，並以 SX-70 等經典機型奠定地位。
* 喀什米爾羊毛（Cashmere Wool）主要產於印度西北方與巴基斯坦邊界處外的[喀什米爾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir)山區（Kashmir）。其纖維細度通常在 14–19 微米，比一般羊毛更柔軟輕盈，觸感滑順且不刺膚，保暖性極佳但重量輕。由於產量稀少，一隻山羊一年只能提供約 150 公克左右的可用羊毛，因此價格昂貴。喀什米爾羊毛常被用於製作高級圍巾、毛衣、大衣及披肩等服飾，需細心保養，避免高溫清洗或過度摩擦，以防縮絨或起球。
* [**Taipei-1**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Taipei+One+supercomputer) is an AI supercomputer built by Nvidia in cooperation with the Taiwanese government, located in Kaohsiung, to strengthen AI sovereignty and digital twin capabilities. Ranked #38 globally in the TOP500, it delivers around 34.53 petaflops of peak performance using 64 Nvidia DGX H100 systems and OVX systems connected via high-speed Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking. About 25% of its compute power** is offered free to Taiwanese academia, startups, and industries for AI R&D, supporting applications from smart healthcare to industrial simulation.
* [**Blackwell**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Blackwell+Nvidia) is Nvidia’s latest GPU microarchitecture, succeeding Hopper and designed for large-scale AI workloads, data-centers, and generative AI. Already in high demand, it represents a leap in performance, efficiency, and security for next-generation AI computing.
* [**SOHO 族**](https://www.google.com/search?q=SOHO+族)（源自 SOHO = Small Office / Home Office）指的是在家或小型辦公室工作的族群，通常是自由工作者（Freelancer）、個人創業者或專業人士，多以專案或合約方式承接工作，常見職業包括網頁設計師、程式開發者、撰稿人、翻譯、插畫師與顧問。此族群的特點是工作地點彈性、時間自主，高度依賴網路工具來進行溝通與協作；相較於遠距工作者（Remote Worker），SOHO 族更強調一種在家/小型辦公室創業或工作的生活型態。
