# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [“There is freedom waiting for you, On the breezes of the sky, And you ask "What if I fall?” Oh but my darling, What if you fly?” — Erin Hanson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1236928-there-is-freedom-waiting-for-you-on-the-breezes-of)
* [“The way to help someone is not to critique what makes them smaller, but to encourage what makes them larger.” — James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/march-20-2025)
* You may be one person in this world, but to one person you may mean the world.
* “Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not.” — Epicurus
* [“Set your course by the stars, not by the lights of every passing ship.” — Omar N. Bradley](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/omar_n_bradley_142744)

# Things I Learned This Week

* A [Etch A Sketch (蝕刻素描)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Etch+A+Sketch) screen is entirely covered on the inside with aluminum powder and tiny beads, held using static charge. Lines are drawn on the toy by scraping off the powder and beads, allowing light to pass through the screen. Shaking the toy re-coats the screen with powder, making it blank again.
* **Daylight Saving Time = DST (日光節約時間)** or **Summer Time (夏令時間)** is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer months in order to extend evening daylight. Typically, clocks are set forward in the spring and set back in the fall. This practice aims to make better use of daylight during the longer days of summer, potentially saving energy and encouraging outdoor leisure activities in the evening.
* 螺栓（Bolt）、螺母（Nut）與螺絲（Screw）各有不同用途：「螺栓」通常與「螺母」搭配使用，而「螺絲」則是直接鎖入材料中固定
* 競走（Race Walking）起源於英國，兩大規則為「腳不能同時離地」與「前腳著地時膝蓋須伸直」，因此競走運動員會特別扭動「髖關節（Hip Joint）」來保持速度與規範
* 地球的赤道周長約 40,075 公里（km）→ 一些長度對比的例子：（1）月亮距離地球約 384,400 公里，這意味著赤道周長大約是從地球到月亮距離的 1/10 多一點。（2）而將它與中國的長度相比，40,075 公里大約是中國東西最長距離 5,000 公里的 8 倍多。（3）另外，從北極到南極的直線距離大約是 12,742 公里，這相當於赤道周長的不到三分之一。
