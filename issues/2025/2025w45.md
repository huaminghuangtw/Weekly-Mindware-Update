# Things I Learned This Week

* [Digital Inverter Technology](https://www.google.com/search?q=Samsung+Digital+Inverter+Technology) by Samsung is an advanced system that uses a microprocessor to precisely control the speed and power of motors or compressors in appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, and vacuum cleaners. Unlike traditional fixed-speed motors, which cycle on and off, the Digital Inverter Motor/Compressor dynamically adjusts its speed to maintain stable performance, optimize energy use, and reduce mechanical stress.
* [IPX](https://www.google.com/search?q=IPX) stands for _Ingress Protection_ and is also referred to as _International Protection_. It’s a marking that indicates the level of protection against water, dust, etc. It also means whether the object is ‘weather-resistant’ or ‘waterproof’ — the greater the IPX rating, the greater the resistance: (1) IPX4 - Protects against splashing of water (equated to ordinary rain) (5) IPX5 - Protects against water jets (6) IPX6 - Protects against powerful water jets (7) IPX7 - Protects in water up to 90 cm (for a minimum of 30 minutes) (8) IPX8 - Protects when immersed in water over 90 cm
* [The Meisner Technique](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Meisner+Technique), developed by Sanford Meisner, is an acting method centered on the idea of “living truthfully under imaginary circumstances.” Meisner’s approach trains actors to respond _spontaneously and authentically_ to their scene partners. The technique emphasizes genuine connection, aiming to free actors from self-consciousness and produce performances that feel real, instinctive, and emotionally alive, rather than pretending.
* [佛手瓜（Chayote）](https://www.google.com/search?q=佛手瓜) 是一種葫蘆科蔬果，原產於墨西哥和中美洲，現廣泛種植於熱帶與亞熱帶地區。其外形形似一雙虔誠敬拜合十的雙手 🙏，因此得名；又因外觀類似水梨或芭樂，在台灣俗稱「梨瓜」，而其嫩芽則稱為「龍鬚菜」。
* [Weapon(s) of Mass Destruction (WMD) 大規模殺傷性武器](https://www.google.com/search?q=Weapon+of+Mass+Destruction) refers to weapons capable of causing large-scale death, destruction, and social disruption, far beyond the impact of conventional arms. They are generally categorized into **nuclear**, **chemical**, **biological**, and **radiological** types.
