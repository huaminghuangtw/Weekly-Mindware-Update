# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [“It's not about the legs, but the heart and mind. So, I believe in calm, simple, low-profile life. You live simple, you train hard, and live an honest life. Then you are free.” — Eliud Kipchoge, Breaking2 (2017 Documentary)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7293698/)
* [“Religion is for people who're afraid of going to hell. Spirituality is for those who've already been there.” — Vine Deloria Jr.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/160879-religion-is-for-people-who-re-afraid-of-going-to-hell)
* “Wherever you are, be all there.” — Jim Elliot
* [“God loves each of us as if there were only one of us.” — Saint Augustine](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/saint_augustine_105351)
* [“If people sat outside and looked at the stars each night, I'll bet they'd live a lot differently.” — Bill Watterson](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/bill_watterson_386589)

# Things I Learned This Week

* “Et cetera,” abbreviated as “etc.,” is a Latin phrase used in English to mean “and other things” or “and so forth”. It indicates that a list is not exhaustive and that there are other items of the same type that are not explicitly mentioned.
* **Hangul (한글)** is the Korean writing system, created in the 15th century by King Sejong to promote literacy. It is made up of **letters**—14 basic **consonants (子音)** and 10 basic **vowels (母音)**—which are combined into square-shaped **syllabic blocks**, each forming one **syllable (音節)** (e.g., “한” = ㅎ + ㅏ + ㄴ). These letters are designed to reflect the shape of the mouth or tongue when pronounced, making Hangul both logical and easy to learn. Hangul is celebrated for its efficiency, scientific design, and cultural importance, with its own public holiday called **Hangul Day**.
* [Tsundoku](https://sketchplanations.com/tsundoku) (積ん読) is a Japanese term that refers to the habit of acquiring books and letting them pile up without reading them.
* An **OG image (Open Graph image)** is a metadata tag used in HTML to define the preview image shown when a webpage is shared on social media. It helps control how your link looks in platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, or X (Twitter), enhancing engagement and branding. By specifying the image using `\<meta property="og:image" content="URL"\>`, you control how your content appears in link previews, which plays a critical role in boosting **click-through rates (CTR)**. Posts with eye-catching visuals generally attract more attention and engagement than plain text links. For best results, the OG image should be 1200×630 pixels with a 1.91:1 aspect ratio to ensure proper display across platforms.
* [PDO（Protected Designation of Origin，原產地命名保護）](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_designation_of_origin) 是歐盟用來保護傳統食品的一種品質標章，保證產品完全在特定地區、使用當地原料並依照傳統工法製作。只有符合這三項條件的產品，才能標示為 PDO，例如希臘的 Feta 起司、義大利的 Parmigiano Reggiano、法國的 Champagne 等。這項制度不僅確保品質與風味，也保護了當地的文化與農業價值。如果食品包裝上有紅黃色的 PDO 標誌，就代表它是歐盟認證的正統產品。
