# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Everyone wants to go to Heaven, but no one wants to die.” — Robert Kiyosaki
* “This world is but canvas to our imaginations.” — Henry David Thoreau
* “You are free, and that is why you are lost.” — Franz Kafka
* [“The unexamined life is not worth living.” — Socrates](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/246-the-unexamined-life-is-not-worth-living)
* [“You are as old as the risks you take. In many ways, aging is not the process of growing old, but rather the slow death of becoming overly protective, scared, and worried about losing what you have. Youth is found in the energy of going for it, taking the risk, and trusting that you'll figure it out along the way.” — James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/march-13-2025)

# Things I Learned This Week

* 「樂齡」是指 55 歲以上、特別是 65 歲退休後的中高齡者，強調他們能夠健康、快樂、自主地生活與學習，積極參與社會與社區活動。年齡範圍通常從 55 歲起算，65 歲以上是主要對象，75 歲以上則屬高齡樂齡族。核心理念包括持續學習、健康促進、社會參與與正向老化，重點在於提升年長者的生活品質與尊嚴，而不單只是年齡的劃分。
* 「智性戀（Sapiosexual）」是一種性傾向，指的是對他人的智力產生愛慕或性吸引力。智性戀者通常認為智力比外貌或身材更重要，並傾向與能進行深入思考與對話的人建立連結。思想上的共鳴與交流能激發他們的情感與性慾，唯有在精神層面建立關係後，才可能進一步發展情感或親密關係。
* [Nutri-Score](https://www.bmel.de/DE/themen/ernaehrung/lebensmittel-kennzeichnung/freiwillige-angaben-und-label/nutri-score/nutri-score_node.html) is a front-of-pack nutrition label that helps consumers assess the overall nutritional quality of food products at a glance. It uses a color-coded scale from 🟢 A (healthiest) to 🔴 E (least healthy), based on an algorithm that balances negative factors (calories, sugar, saturated fat, salt) with positive ones (fiber, protein, and content of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts).
* 「皈（ㄍㄨㄟ）依」象徵著一個人從此開始正式走上佛道修行的路，也代表願意放下過去的錯誤觀念、行為，依照佛法生活。簡單來說，「皈依」就是「歸投依靠」的意思，它就像一個心靈的「重新開始」或承諾。特別是在佛教中，皈依的對象是「三寶」：佛（覺悟的導師）、法（佛陀的教義）和僧（修行的僧團）。
* Patagonia (巴塔哥尼亞) is a vast region located at the southern tip of South America, divided between **Argentina** and **Chile**. It is known for its diverse and dramatic landscapes, including the Andes mountains, glaciers, deserts, and rugged coastlines. The area is sparsely populated and is a popular destination for outdoor activities such as hiking, climbing, and wildlife viewing.
