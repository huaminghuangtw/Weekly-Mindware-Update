# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “People tend to complicate their own lives, as if living weren’t already complicated enough.” — Carlos Ruiz Zafon
* “Those who have a ‘why’ to live, can bear with almost any ‘how’.” — Viktor Frankl
* [“Avoiding climate breakdown will require cathedral thinking. We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.” — Greta Thunberg](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg-full-speech-to-mps-you-did-not-act-in-time)
* “I make a point to appreciate all the little things in my life, because I learned early that if you don’t, you get disappointed a lot. If you do, you might be pleasantly surprised quite often. I go out and smell the air after a good, hard rain. I re-read passages from my favorite books. I hold the little treasures that somebody special gave me. By keeping my eyes open for unexpected joys, I find the world gives back more than we sometimes think.” — Dolly Parton
* “If light is in your heart, you will find your way home.” — Rumi

* 滷肉飯上的黃色配料通常是醃白蘿蔔，帶有微酸微甜的口感，用來解膩
* 在台灣騎腳踏車的外國傳教士主要是摩門教（耶穌基督後期聖徒教會）的傳教士，他們經常穿白襯衫、打領帶，在世界各地傳教
* 高雄兩座高樓：長谷世貿聯合國大樓（50 層），東帝士建台大樓（85 層）
* 柏林圍牆（Berliner Mauer）建於 1961 年，於 1989 年倒塌，存在了 28 年，象徵冷戰時期東西德的分裂
