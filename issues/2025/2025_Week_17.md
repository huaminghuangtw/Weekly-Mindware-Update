# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “We do not ‘come into’ this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree.” — Alan Watts → We don’t go through life, we are life.
* “Stop being a prisoner of your past. Become the architect of your future.” — Robin Sharma
* “Your life is designed to get the results you are getting right now. Whether you realize it or not, you are the architect.” — Shane Parrish
* “Owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing that we’ll ever do.” — Brené Brown
* “We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.” — Martin Luther King Jr.

# Things I Learned This Week

* A “[tropical/solar year](https://www.google.com/search?q=tropical+year) 回歸/太陽年” is ~365.2425 days — slightly less than 365.25 days — and more accurate than just counting 365 or 366 days. It’s the time it takes the Earth to complete one cycle of seasons, meaning from one vernal equinox to the next. That’s why calendars add a leap day every four years (mostly) — to stay synced with Earth’s orbit and the seasons, resulting in a “[leap year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year)” with 366 days instead of 365. This extra day occurs in each year that is a multiple of 4, except for years evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.
* The [Guinness World Records (金氏世界紀錄)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Guinness+World+Record) is an organization that documents and verifies world records across a vast range of categories, from human achievements to natural phenomena. It was originally known as The Guinness Book of Records, first published in 1955, and was created by Sir Hugh Beaver, the managing director of the Guinness Brewery.
* A NOP (short for **No Operation**, often written as **no-op**) is an instruction in a computer program that does nothing when executed. It’s effectively a placeholder that has no effect on the state of the processor or program.
* EMBA = Executive Master of Business Administration = 高階經理人碩士班 = 高階管理碩士 = 在職工商管理碩士
* The Commonwealth Games (大英國協運動會) is an international multi-sport event where athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations, a group of former British Empire countries, compete. Held every four years, the Games emphasize friendly competition and cultural exchange, featuring a wide range of sports and fostering solidarity among member nations.
