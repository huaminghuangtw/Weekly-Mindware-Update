# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.” — Dhammapada
* “Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness.” — Desmond Tutu
* “The key, at least for me, has been to let go. Let go of the ego, let go of attachments, let go of who I think I should be, who others think I should be. And as I do that, the real me emerges, far far better than the Kamal I projected to the world. There is a strength in this vulnerability that cannot be described, only experienced.” ― Kamal Ravikant, [Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/21367410)
* “The only way to ease our fear and be truly happy is to acknowledge our fear and look deeply at its source.” — Pema Chödrön
* “Life’s too mysterious to take too serious.” — Mary Engelbreit

# Things I Learned This Week

* **[Transliterate (音譯)](https://www.google.com/search?q=transliterate)** is the practice of converting text from one **writing system** into another, based on **phonetic equivalence** rather than meaning. This process is distinct from **translation (翻譯)**, which conveys the semantic content of a word. Transliteration helps preserve the original **pronunciation** when switching between languages with different scripts—for instance, converting the Arabic name “محمد” to “Muhammad” in the Latin alphabet. It is especially useful for **proper nouns**, **place names**, and **foreign terms** that lack direct translations.
* 瑞士的「首都」是「伯恩（Bern）」。其他主要城市有「蘇黎世（Zurich）」、「日內瓦（Geneve）」與「琉森（Luzern）」。伯恩是愛因斯坦提出「狹義相對論」的地方，「Bern」意為「熊」，熊是城市象徵，廣見於市徽與地標。它也被稱為「噴泉之都」，舊城中眾多歷史噴泉皆可直接飲用。
* 全球三大「[熱帶雨林帶](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E7%83%AD%E5%B8%A6%E9%9B%A8%E6%9E%97)」為「南美洲的亞馬遜雨林（Amazon Rainforest）」、「非洲的剛果盆地（Congo Basin）」與「東南亞的湄公盆地（Mekong Basin）」（以「印尼」為核心）。這三大區域佔全球熱帶雨林總面積的 80%，擁有地球近半數的生物多樣性，對全球氣候穩定、碳儲存與降雨循環至關重要。
* The Sleep Mode (舒眠模式) in air conditioners is a smart function that enhances **sleep comfort** and promotes **energy-saving** by automatically adjusting **temperature** and **fan speed** based on typical **sleep-stage body changes**. As the **metabolism slows** and **body temperature lowers** during sleep, the system gradually **raises the set temperature** (usually by 0.5°C to 2°C) and reduces **fan noise**, preventing overcooling and ensuring a quieter environment. Ideal for use at night, especially for **children** or the **elderly**, it helps maintain a balanced sleeping climate while reducing electricity consumption.
* 「**[載波聚合（Carrier Aggregation）](https://www.google.com/search?q=載波聚合)** 」是 4G 與 5G 網路中的關鍵技術，透過**整合多個頻段的無線頻寬**，讓手機能夠同時使用多條「資料通道」，就像在多線道高速公路上行駛，使得上網速度更快、容量更大、訊號更穩。這項技術能顯著提升下載與上傳速度、改善基地台的使用效率，並在網路壅塞或邊緣地區提供更穩定的連線品質。使用者裝置與電信基地台皆需支援此技術，方可發揮最大效能。
