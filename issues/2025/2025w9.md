# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “We should always allow some time to elapse, for time discloses the truth.” — Seneca
* [“There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life.” — John Lennon](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/26411-there-are-two-basic-motivating-forces-fear-and-love-when)

* “Only by acceptance of the past, can you alter it.” — T.S. Eliot
