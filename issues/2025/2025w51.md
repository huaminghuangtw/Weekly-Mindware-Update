# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “We had concluded that no one can make a person happy. You can make a person smile; you can compose a moment that helps a person to feel good; you can deliver a joke that makes a person laugh; you can create an environment where a person feels safe. We can and must be helpful and kind and loving, but whether a person is happy or not is utterly out of your control. Every person must wage a solitary internal war for their own contentment.” ― Will Smith, [Will](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/91549698)
* “It was the deepest, existential human question. It may be the most important question that we as humans ever ask each other. Does it matter to you how I feel?” ― Will Smith, [Will](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/91549698)
* “Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.” — T.S. Eliot
* [“Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn’t supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something.” — Rainbow Rowell, Eleanor & Park](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/756552-eleanor-was-right-she-never-looked-nice-she-looked-like)
* “Don’t chase people. Be yourself, do your own thing and work hard. The right people - the ones who really belong in your life - will come to your. And stay.” — Will Smith

# Things I Learned This Week

* [**閃電麥坤 (Lightning McQueen)**](https://www.google.com/search?q=閃電麥坤) 是皮克斯動畫工作室（Pixar Animation Studios）《汽車總動員》（Cars）系列的主角，一輛充滿野心、速度極快的年輕賽車，車號 95，由 Owen Wilson 配音。起初，他自信甚至有些自負，只追求勝利與名氣，但在來到小鎮水箱溫泉鎮 (Radiator Springs) 後，透過與當地居民互動，學會了友誼、謙遜與團隊合作的重要性。他的口頭禪「Ka-chow!」象徵自信與速度，麥坤代表了堅持與學習放手的智慧。他從一個衝動的賽車，成長為懂得引導他人的導師；從「我想贏」的自傲，轉變爲「我想幫助別人贏」的謙卑。
* **[Pickleball](https://www.google.com/search?q=Pickleball)（匹克球）** is a fast-growing sport that combines elements of **tennis, badminton, and table tennis**, played with a solid paddle and a perforated plastic ball on a small court. It can be played in **singles or doubles**, with a **non-volley zone (“kitchen”)** that emphasizes strategy over power. [Compared to](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/tw/fitness/work-outs/g62426887/pickleball-vs-padel/) **[Padel](https://www.google.com/search?q=Padel)（板式網球）**, which is played in **doubles only** on an enclosed court using walls for extended rallies, Pickleball is easier to learn, low-impact, and more social, making it ideal for beginners or mixed-age groups.
* [Egosurfing](https://www.google.com/search?q=egosurfing) refers to the act of searching the Internet for your own name to see what information about you is publicly available. It’s often done out of curiosity, professional interest, or personal reputation management. People egosurf to check social media mentions, news articles, blog posts, or other online content that could impact their privacy, image, or career. Essentially, it’s a form of “online self-monitoring,” allowing individuals to see how they appear to others on the web.
* [**剛需**](https://www.google.com/search?q=剛需) 指的是剛性或必須的需求，具有不可或缺、彈性低及長期穩定的特性。常見例子包括住房、食物、醫療和交通。在房地產市場中，「剛需房」是指購房者出於真實居住需求而購買的房產，而非投資或炒作。
* [Élan vital](https://www.google.com/search?q=Élan+vital)（生命衝力）是法國哲學家 Henri Bergson 提出，用來描述生命不斷演化與創造的內在動能；在他的觀點中，生命並非單純由物理或機械因果推動，而是一股持續前進、突破、生成新可能的創造力量，使生物能夠自我更新、邁向更高複雜度與自由度。
