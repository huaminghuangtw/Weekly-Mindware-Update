# Things I Learned This Week

* **[農家樂](https://www.google.com/search?q=農家樂)** 是中國於 1990 年代興起的鄉村旅遊模式，核心理念是「住農家屋、吃農家飯、干農家活、享農家樂」。它以農戶家庭經營為主，提供農家菜肴、農事體驗、果蔬採摘、親子遊樂等活動，滿足城市居民對休閒放鬆與返璞歸真的需求，同時促進農村經濟與就業。近年來，農家樂逐漸衍生出「牧家樂」、「漁家樂」、「林家樂」等多樣形式，成為兼具地方特色與文化體驗的熱門休閒選擇。
* **[Finger Food 吮（ㄕㄨㄣˇ）指美食](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_food)** refers to small, bite-sized dishes designed to be eaten directly with the hands, without the need for utensils. They are often served at buffets, parties, receptions, catered events, and casual gatherings. Finger foods include items like **[sliders 迷你漢堡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(sandwich))**, **[skewers 烤肉串](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewer)**, **[canapés 開胃小菜](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canap%C3%A9)**, etc.
* [**Burning Man 火人祭/節**](https://burningman.org) is an annual **event and cultural gathering** held in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, USA. It is renowned for its **temporary city** known as Black Rock City, which is built by participants who embrace [principles](https://burningman.org/about/10-principles/) such as **self-expression 展現自我**, **self-reliance 自力更生**, **inclusivity 包容**, and **decommodification 去商品化**. The event culminates in the burning of a large wooden effigy, “the Man,” symbolizing themes of **impermanence** and **creative freedom**. Art installations, theme camps, and interactive performances are central to the experience, with no commercial transactions—only a **gift economy** operates. Since its beginnings in 1986 on a San Francisco beach, Burning Man has grown into a global cultural movement inspiring regional events worldwide.
* **[Minecraft《當個創世神》](https://www.minecraft.net/)** is a globally popular **sandbox video game** originally developed by **Markus Persson** and later acquired by **Microsoft**. Released in **2011** by **Mojang**, a Swedish video game developer based in Stockholm, it allows players to explore, build, and survive in a **blocky, procedurally generated 3D world**. Minecraft is one of the **best-selling games of all time**, with a huge following across ages. It’s widely used in **education** to teach coding, design, and teamwork, and has influenced pop culture, streaming, and even real-world architecture.
* **國曆 (Gregorian Calendar)**，也稱為 **西曆 (Western Calendar)** 或 **公曆 (Public Calendar)**，是以太陽運行為基準的現代國際通用曆法，每月天數相對固定。**農曆 (Lunar Calendar)**，又稱 **陰陽曆 (Lunisolar Calendar)**，結合太陽與月亮的運行規律，每月約 29–30 天，年份需透過「閏月 (Leap Month)」 調整以對齊太陽年。
