# Things I Learned This Week

* 胼（ㄆㄧㄢˊ）胝（ㄓ）（[Callus](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zht/%E8%A9%9E%E5%85%B8/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AA%9E-%E6%BC%A2%E8%AA%9E-%E7%B9%81%E9%AB%94/callus)），俗稱老繭、繭子、鷄眼等，指皮膚上出現變厚、變硬的地方。
* An eggcorn (口/耳誤詞) is a word or phrase created by mishearing or misinterpreting another, replacing an element with a similar-sounding one. → e.g., (1) “acorn” → “eggcorn” (2) “surname” → “sir name” (3) “Quote, unquote” → “Quote on quote”
* [Tally marks (正字號), a way to count by drawing lines, usually in groups of five, to keep track of numbers, are different around the world.](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/o46pw2/tally_marks_are_different_around_the_world/)
* [TuneIn is a global audio streaming service providing news, radio, sports, music, and podcasts to over 75 million monthly active users.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TuneIn)
* A skeuomorph (擬物化設計) is a design element that retains ornamental or functional aspects of an older design, even when no longer necessary. It mimics the appearance or structure of a similar artifact made from a different material. Apple, under **Steve Jobs and Scott Forstall**, heavily used skeuomorphic design in iOS and macOS, making digital interfaces resemble real-world objects (e.g., [iBooks as a wooden shelf](https://www.google.com/search?q=iBooks+as+a+wooden+shelf)). This changed in **iOS 7 (2013)** under **Jony Ive**, who introduced a **flat, minimalist** aesthetic, marking a shift from realism to modern simplicity.
