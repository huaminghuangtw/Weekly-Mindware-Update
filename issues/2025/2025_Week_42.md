# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Success is something you attract by the person you become.” — Jim Rohn
* “I’ve learned that you shouldn’t go through life with a catcher’s mitt on both hands; you need to be able to throw something back.” — Maya Angelou
* [“A person’s a person, no matter how small.” — Dr. Seuss](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/dr_seuss_102344)
* “The greatest miracle is to be alive.” — Thich Nhat Hanh
* “All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost.” — J.R.R. Tolkien

# Things I Learned This Week

* **[Rückenfigur](https://sketchplanations.com/ruckenfigur)** — from the German words _Rücken_ (back) and _Figur_ (figure) — refers to a compositional technique where a person is depicted from behind, gazing out toward the scene rather than facing the viewer. This perspective invites the audience to see the world through the figure’s eyes, creating a sense of contemplation, distance, and shared experience between the viewer and the subject.
* [**Urchin Tracking Module (UTM)**](https://www.google.com/search?q=UTM) parameters are small pieces of text added to the end of a URL that help track where website traffic comes from. They allow marketers to measure the effectiveness of campaigns. The main UTM parameters include **utm_source** (the origin of traffic, e.g., `buttondown`), **utm_medium** (the marketing medium, e.g., `email`), **utm_campaign** (the campaign name, e.g., `weekly-newsletter`), **utm_term** (optional, for paid search keywords), and **utm_content** (optional, to distinguish between multiple links or ads). By appending these to URLs, analytics tools can accurately attribute traffic and provide insights for data-driven decisions.
* 「病毒式行銷（[Viral Marketing](https://www.google.com/search?q=Viral+Marketing)）」指透過大眾將訊息廉價複製並傳播給其他受眾，快速擴大影響力，是現代網路與社群行銷常用策略。
* **[NVLink Fusion](https://www.google.com/search?q=NVLink+Fusion)** is a new technology introduced by NVIDIA in 2025 that helps companies build powerful AI systems by connecting NVIDIA’s hardware with third-party processors. It enables semi-custom AI infrastructure by allowing companies to design their own ASICs or CPUs (or otherwise custom silicon) and integrate them into NVIDIA’s NVLink interconnect fabric and rack-scale architecture.
* **[甘酒（Amazake）](https://www.google.com/search?q=甘酒)** 是日本傳統的發酵飲品，意為「甜酒」，但多數版本不含酒精。它以米、米麴或酒粕（ㄆㄛˋ）製成，口感濃稠、自然甘甜，被稱為「喝的點滴」。依製法可分為兩類：以米與米麴發酵、不含酒精、富含維生素與酵素的「米麴甘酒」（又稱「甘糀（ㄏㄨㄚ）」），以及以酒粕與糖調製、略帶酒香的「酒粕甘酒」。自古記載於《日本書紀》，江戶時代曾是夏季補身飲品，如今則於新年與冬季祭典常見。因其營養豐富、促進腸道健康與代謝，甘酒成為兼具傳統文化與健康功效的現代日常飲品。
