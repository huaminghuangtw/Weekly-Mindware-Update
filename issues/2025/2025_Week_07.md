* [Early-Arriver Arbitrage (First-Mover Advantage) — It’s easy to think you’re already late to an arena even when it’s still so early. A crowd can look big until you see how big it can become; only then do you realize it was actually tiny before. […] If you can, get to the arena before the crowd shows up.](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/before-the-crow)

# Things I Learned This Week

* What is stock photography? (↔ individual photography) Stock photos are photographs that are licensed for commercial purposes. Commonly, marketing agencies and people who need a photo for graphic design will use them to add personality and excitement to an image — without having to conduct a photoshoot of their own. They're usually not tied to a specific place or time, for good reason.
* [台灣的國民法官制度於 2021 年實施，2023 年正式上路，旨在讓一群來自各行各業的民眾共同參與刑案之審判，與職業法官一起討論並裁決案件，以增進司法的透明度和公信力，彰顯國民主權理念。國民法官雖然沒有法律背景，但可以把多元的背景、價值觀、生活經驗等帶進法庭。](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/%E5%9C%8B%E6%B0%91%E6%B3%95%E5%AE%98%E6%B3%95)
* Pancetta (pronounced pan-CHET-tah) is a salt-cured pork belly (豬五花) meat product in Italy. It can be eaten both uncooked \& cooked, sold both sliced (best for sandwiches) \& cubed (best for cooking), and is often used to add depth to soups \& (carbonara) pastas. Note that Pancetta is smoked, whereas Bacon is unsmoked.
