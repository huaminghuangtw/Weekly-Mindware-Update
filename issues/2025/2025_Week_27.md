# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Anyone can carry his burden, however hard, until nightfall. Anyone can do his work, however hard, for one day. Anyone can live sweetly, patiently, lovingly, purely, till the sun goes down. And this is all life really means.” — Robert Louis Stevenson
* “Since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special attention to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstances, are brought into closer connection with you.” — Saint Augustine
* [“There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.” — Edith Wharton](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/edith_wharton_100511)
* “People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built.” — Eleanor Roosevelt
* “Think of yourself in a concert hall listening to the strains of the sweetest music when you suddenly remember that you forgot to lock your car. You are anxious about the car, you cannot walk out of the hall and you cannot enjoy the music. There you have a perfect image of life as it is lived by most human beings.” — Anthony de Mello
