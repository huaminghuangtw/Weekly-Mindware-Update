# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “The sea is pure only when it is deep.” — Soren Kierkegaard
* [You’re judged by your peaks, not your sums. In other words, it’s not about your sheer output, but about the quality of your output. Create a lot at first. Then, slowly start to focus your creation on the most interesting opportunities. Sums first, peaks later.](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/i-co-hosted-a-retreat-with-richard-branson--heres-what-i-learned)
* “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” — Aristotle
* [“She was afraid of heights but she was much more afraid of never flying.” — Atticus Poetry, Love Her Wild](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8373671-she-was-afraid-of-heights-but-she-was-much-more)
* Life will test you with the same challenge until you learn the lesson. The same fight in every relationship. The same burnout in every job. The same regret in every missed chance. Until you do the _inner_ work, the _outer_ world won’t change.

# Things I Learned This Week

* [**一泊二食**](https://www.google.com/search?q=一泊二食)（いっぱくにしょく, Ippaku Nishoku）是日本旅館與溫泉旅館常見的住宿方案，意指「住宿一晚，附帶兩餐」，通常包含晚餐與早餐。其特色在於方便性，讓旅客免去找餐廳的麻煩；餐食往往呈現當地特色，例如晚餐多為傳統會席料理或地方菜餚，早餐則常見和式或西式自助餐。
* A **[Narcissistic Number 自戀數](https://www.google.com/search?q=narcissistic+number)** (also called an **Armstrong Number** or **Pluperfect Digital Invariant, PDI**) is a number that equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, **1634** is a 4-digit narcissistic number: (1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634).
* **ARIA** ([Accessible Rich Internet Applications](https://www.google.com/search?q=ARIA+Accessible+Rich+Internet+Applications)) is a set of **attributes** in HTML designed to enhance **accessibility**, particularly for users of **screen readers** and other assistive technologies. It allows developers to communicate an element’s **role**, **state**, and **properties** that may not be clear from standard HTML alone. Common **ARIA attributes** include **aria-label**, **aria-labelledby**, **aria-hidden**, **aria-expanded**, and **role**.
* **[Thrifting](https://www.google.com/search?q=thrifting)** refers to the practice of shopping at **thrift stores, flea markets, garage sales, or online resale platforms** to purchase **secondhand goods** at affordable prices. Originally driven by budget-conscious consumers, thrifting has gained popularity among people who value **sustainability, vintage fashion, and unique finds**, as it promotes **reuse and recycling** while reducing waste in a fast-fashion world. The phrase **“Go Thrifting” (去二手店淘寶/挖寶)** is often used to describe the activity of going out to hunt for bargains or unique items in secondhand shops.
* [**BookCrossing (= 圖書漂流 = 漂書)**](https://www.google.com/search?q=BookCrossing) is a worldwide community initiative that transforms reading into a social and global experience. Participants register the book on the platform to receive a unique **BCID (BookCrossing ID number)**, label the book with this ID, and then release the book “into the wild” by leaving it in public places. Each finder can use the BCID to log their discovery, share thoughts, and continue the cycle. This process allows readers to track the journey of books across different cities or continents, effectively turning the whole world into one big library.
