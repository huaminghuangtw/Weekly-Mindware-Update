# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Money & success don't change people; they merely amplify what is already there.” — Will Smith
* “It’s respectable to lose to the universe. It’s a tragedy to lose to yourself.” — Will Smith
* “Awareness is the greatest agent for change.” — Eckhart Tolle
* “Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you'll look back and realize they were the big things.” — Kurt Vonnegut
* “I enjoy life when things are happening. I don't care if it's good things or bad things. That means you're alive.” — Joan Rivers

# Things I Learned This Week

* The [**PDCA**](https://www.google.com/search?q=PDCA) cycle—also known as the **Plan–Do–Check–Act** cycle—is a continuous improvement framework used in management, manufacturing, and personal productivity. It emphasizes **systematic problem-solving** by first **planning** a change or solution, then **doing** (executing) it on a small scale, **checking** the results through data and feedback, and finally **acting** by standardizing the improvement or adjusting the approach for the next cycle. Its **iterative** nature creates a **loop of ongoing optimization**.
* [汗蒸幕（韓文：찜질방；英文：Jjimjilbang）](https://www.google.com/search?q=汗蒸幕) 是韓國特色的公共浴場與休閒空間，結合澡堂 / 浴區、多種蒸房與休息區，提供洗澡、蒸汗、休憩及過夜等服務。傳統的 **Hanjeungmak (한증막)** 以窯爐加熱方式為特色，現代汗蒸幕則包含鹽房、冰房、礦石房等多種主題房間。
* **[School 42](https://www.google.com/search?q=School+42)**—also known as **École 42**—is a tuition-free, teacher-less coding school founded by French entrepreneur **[Xavier Niel](https://www.google.com/search?q=Xavier+Niel)**. It’s built on a **project-based**, **self-directed**, and **collaboration-driven** model with no syllabus and no textbooks. Students learn by completing real programming challenges and evaluating one another. Its admission hinges on the intensive month-long **[Piscine](https://www.google.com/search?q=Piscine) (游泳池)**, which tests persistence rather than prior experience, and its curriculum emphasizes **C programming**, **algorithms**, and fundamental **problem-solving** before expanding into areas like operating systems, graphics, and cybersecurity.
* 「畸零地」是指面積過小或形狀不規則的土地，例如三角形、梯形等，不符合法定寬度、深度或角度的要求。這類土地原則上不能直接興建建築物，除非透過與鄰地合併或調整地形等方式，使其符合相關規定後，才能進行使用。也因為這些地形特殊、用途受限、取得成本低，部分投機人士利用畸零地卡住整體開發或道路拓寬的關鍵位置，用極小面積阻斷工程，藉此向政府或建商要求高額補償，被稱為「土地蟑螂」。
* 「管收」與「羈押」雖然都是暫時剝奪人身自由，並關押於看守所，但兩者在本質上截然不同：羈押屬於刑事程序，針對刑事犯罪嫌疑人，目的是「防逃、防串供」，以利案件偵查或審判；管收則屬於行政或民事執行程序，針對欠稅或欠款的義務人，目的是透過限制自由的手段來「逼你還錢」。
