# Things I Learned This Week

* Seed cycling (種子循環) is a natural wellness practice aimed at supporting hormonal balance throughout the menstrual cycle by consuming specific seeds during different phases. In the follicular phase (days 1–14), flax and pumpkin seeds are eaten to support estrogen levels and prepare for ovulation. In the luteal phase (days 15–28), sesame and sunflower seeds are used to boost progesterone and support hormone detox. Typically, 1 tablespoon of each ground seed is consumed daily.
* A [camera trap](https://www.google.com/search?q=camera+trap) is an automatic camera equipped with motion or infrared sensors (typically PIR or AIR) that captures images or videos when triggered by movement or heat, such as from animals or humans. Widely used in wildlife research and conservation, it enables the unobtrusive monitoring of animal behavior and ecosystems by operating quietly and continuously, often revealing natural behaviors that would be hidden in the presence of humans.
* 消化餅（Digestive Biscuit）是一種源自英國的餅乾，含有大量膳食纖維，如全麥麵粉與燕麥，能刺激腸道蠕動，有助於排便，因此常被認為具有促進消化的效果。除了單吃之外，消化餅也常被壓碎後用來製作起司蛋糕的餅底。
* The [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu) is an EU law that governs how personal data of EU residents is collected, used, and stored. Effective since May 2018, it applies globally to any organization handling EU citizens’ data. GDPR is based on principles like data minimization, purpose limitation, accuracy, and accountability, and gives individuals rights such as access, rectification, erasure, and objection. It requires transparency and security in data processing, and non-compliance can lead to heavy fines—up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover. (Similar: [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa))
* n8n (pronounced “n-eight-n”) is a workflow automation tool that lets you connect different apps and services to automate tasks—similar to Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat)—but with a focus on flexibility and developer-friendliness. Founded in 2019 by Jan Oberhauser, n8n is headquartered in Berlin, Germany.
