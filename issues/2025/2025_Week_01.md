# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [Identity lags reality by 1-2 years. There’s a lot of psychological fallout from a rapid change in status. \[…\] Try to enjoy the rollercoaster as best you can, soon you won’t be able to remember what it was like to be at the bottom.](https://x.com/ChrisWillx/status/1646572145533747219)
* “Attitude drives actions. Actions drive results. Results drive lifestyles.” — Jim Rohn
* “The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude.” — Oprah Winfrey
* “Two characteristics shared by gods and men (and every rational creature): i. Not to let others hold you back. ii. To locate goodness in thinking and doing the right thing, and to limit your desires to that.” — Marcus Aurelius
* “This is the real secret to life—to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.” — Alan Watts

# Things I Learned This Week

* **Torrenting** is a term used for sharing, distributing, and downloading files on the Internet using the BitTorrent protocol in a decentralized, peer-to-peer manner (without central storage). Usually, when you download a file from the internet, you get that file from a server. Say 1000 people want to download that file, the server has to “serve” it 1000 times, which means the server has to have (aka pay for) the bandwidth to do so. Torrents instead have the file broken into chunks—Instead of getting all the chunks from a single server, chunks are shared amongst “peers”.
* In linguistics, **code-switching** or **language alternation** occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more languages, or language varieties, in the context of a single conversation or situation. → 晶晶體
* **On premise (= On-prem) 地端** refers to software or services that are installed and run on _local_ servers or computers within an organization’s physical location. ↔ **On demand 雲端**, aka _cloud-based_ or _Software as a Service (SaaS)_, refers to software or services that are hosted on _external_ servers and accessed over the internet.
* **Yūgen (幽玄)** is a Japanese aesthetic sense, meaning “mysterious profound beauty.” It can be experienced in moments like watching a sunset behind mountains or walking into a deep forest, where the beauty and mystery (1) are felt rather than seen directly (2) don’t exist in the literal sense of the word.
* **Segue** is a verb that means “to move without stopping from one topic, song, etc., to another.” **[Segway](https://de-de.segway.com/)**, on the other hand, is a trademarked name for an electric transportation device. Both words have the same pronunciation.
