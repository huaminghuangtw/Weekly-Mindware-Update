# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [“Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem. We all have twenty-four hour days.” — Zig Ziglar](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/270489-lack-of-direction-not-lack-of-time-is-the-problem)
* “The mind craves for formulations and definitions, always eager to squeeze reality into a verbal shape.” — Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj
* [To get status, you have to give up status. You have to sacrifice some existing status to make it back and more. This is especially true in creative fields and high-upside opportunities. Writers, musicians, actors, directors, entrepreneurs must all do their time in status limbo. And you don’t know how long that time will be. How well you tolerate this state can be the “winning” difference between you and someone just as talented and hard-working as you.](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/status-limbo)
* [“Yes, I decided, a man can truly change. The events of the past year have taught me much about myself, and a few universal truths. I learned, for instance, that while wounds can be inflicted easily upon those we love, it’s often much more difficult to heal them. Yet the process of healing those wounds provided the richest experience of my life, leading me to believe that while I’ve often overestimated what I could accomplish in a day, I had underestimated what I could do in a year. But most of all, I learned that it’s possible for two people to fall in love all over again, even when there’s been a lifetime of disappointment between them.” — Nicholas Sparks, The Wedding](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/167046-yes-i-decided-a-man-can-truly-change-the-events)
* [“As soon as we take one thing by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.” — John Muir](https://sketchplanations.com//hitched-to-everything-else)

# Things I Learned This Week

* 中國四大菜系: 代表北方的魯菜系、代表江南的淮揚 (江蘇省淮安、揚州) 菜系、代表華南的粵菜系、代表西南的川菜系
* 奧勒岡草 (Oregano) = 披薩草 = 牛至
* 腰圍身高比 WHtR (waist-to-height ratio) measures body fat distribution by dividing waist circumference by height. It is a simpler, more reliable predictor of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke risk than 身體質量指數 BMI (body mass index), making it an effective indicator of early health risks from central obesity.
* Embroidered Towel (個人化/客製化) 刺繡毛巾
* VISION EQXX - The most efficient vehicle that Mercedes-Benz ever built
