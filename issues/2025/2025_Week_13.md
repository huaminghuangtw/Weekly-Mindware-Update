# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [“The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.” — Albert Einstein, The World As I See It](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4093-the-most-beautiful-experience-we-can-have-is-the-mysterious)
* “Don’t ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” — Howard Thurman
* [“In every change, in every falling leaf there is some pain, some beauty. And that's the way new leaves grow.” ― Amit Ray](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3206891-in-every-change-in-every-falling-leaf-there-is-some)
* “What we know matters but who we are matters more.” — Brené Brown
* “If you are still looking for that one person who will change your life, take a look in the mirror.” — Roman Price

# Things I Learned This Week

* [Nyepi](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nyepi), also known as the “Balinese Day of Silence”, is a Hindu celebration held every Isakawarsa (“new year”) in Bali, Indonesia. It lasts for 24 hours, beginning at 6:00 AM on the day of Nyepi and ending at 6:00 AM the following day. During this time, the island observes complete silence, with no activities allowed, including travel, work, or entertainment. Even the airport shuts down for 24 hours. The day is dedicated to self-reflection, meditation, and spiritual cleansing, as the entire island enters a state of peace and quiet to start the new year with a clean slate. (寧靜日/靜居日是印尼峇里島著名的國定假日，也是印度教的新年，是全球唯一一個將整座島嶼封閉並暫停所有活動的節日。)
* Remembrance Day（國殤紀念日）每年 11 月 11 日，紀念第一次世界大戰於 1918 年的結束，英聯邦國家會在這天悼念陣亡士兵
* 美國兩大政黨象徵：民主黨（Democratic Party）以「驢子」代表，象徵親民形象；共和黨（Republican Party）則以「大象」代表，象徵力量與穩定。
* 令（Ream）是紙張的計算單位，一令通常為 500 張
* 「代針筆」是一種適合繪圖與精細描繪的筆，墨水防水且線條穩定，常用於建築、漫畫與設計繪圖
