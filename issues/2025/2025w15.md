# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Sometimes you have to travel a long way to find what is near.” — Paulo Coelho
* “Older men declare war. But it is youth that must fight and die.” — Herbert Hoover
* “Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.” — Rabindranath Tagore
* “I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every mischance in life was an opportunity to behave well. Every mischance in life was an opportunity to learn something and that your duty was not to be immersed in self-pity, but to utilize the terrible blow in a constructive fashion. That is a very good idea.” — Charlie Munger
* “Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.” — Helen Keller

# Things I Learned This Week

* MTV（Music Television）是以播放音樂錄影帶（MV，Music Video）為主的電視頻道，影響了全球流行音樂文化
* 儲備幹部（Management Associate, MA / Management Trainee, MT）是企業培養未來管理人才的制度，新進員工經過培訓後可晉升為管理階層
* 大氣中的氣體與海水間的氣體交換大約每六年可完全循環一次，影響全球的碳循環與氣候變化
* ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, a framework used to assess a company’s sustainability and ethical performance, focusing on environmental impact, social responsibility, and corporate governance practices.
* 「形而上（Metaphysical）」與「形而下（Physical）」是中國哲學中用來區分「抽象」與「具體」的概念，出自《易經》：「形而上者謂之道，形而下者謂之器。」形而上指的是無形的、本質的、抽象的事物，如道理、理念、精神、宇宙本源等，屬於哲學與思辨層面；形而下則是有形的、具體的、可觀察的事物，如器物、身體、自然現象，屬於現實與實踐層面。簡言之，形而上關注「為什麼（Why）」，形而下關注「是什麼（What）」與「怎麼做（How）」。有時「形而上」會被理解為比較空泛或理論性的思考，而「形而下」則是實際可操作或有用的東西。
