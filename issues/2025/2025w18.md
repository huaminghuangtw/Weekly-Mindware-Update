# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [“What is a soul? It’s like electricity - we don’t really know what it is, but it’s a force that can light a room.” — Ray Charles](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/ray_charles_167077)
* “If you want to fly, you have to give up everything that weighs you down.” — Toni Morrison
* [“Art is either plagiarism or revolution.” — Paul Gauguin](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/paul_gauguin_109850)
* “If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door.” — Milton Berle
* “Life calls not for perfection, but for completeness.” — Carl Jung

# Things I Learned This Week

* 說一個人「很卷」，是指這個人非常努力、拼命投入，甚至有點過度競爭的意思。這個詞最早來自中國大陸的網絡流行語「內卷」，形容在一個封閉的系統裡，大家不斷競爭但整體沒有實質進步，結果是越努力越疲憊。比如說：（1）一個學生每天學習到凌晨，為了考第一，別人也不得不跟著熬夜，這就是「很卷」。（2）公司員工下班後還在加班發 PPT、寫報告，也是「很卷」。簡單說，「很卷」就是太拼了、太過競爭了，有時候帶點諷刺或無奈的感覺。
* In software development, **onshore** refers to teams located in the same country as the client, offering easier communication and collaboration but at a higher cost due to local labor rates. **Offshore** teams are based in distant countries, typically chosen for lower costs and access to global talent, though they may present challenges like time zone differences and communication barriers. A middle-ground option is **nearshore**, where teams are in nearby countries, balancing cost savings with more convenient time zones and cultural alignment.
* The Ryder Cup（萊德盃） and Laver Cup（拉維盃） are international team competitions in golf and tennis, respectively. The Ryder Cup pits Team Europe against Team USA in golf, while the Laver Cup features a tennis rivalry between Team Europe and Team World. Both events are known for their exciting team dynamics and showcase world-class athletes in a non-traditional team format.
* Tabata (全身燃脂訓練法) is a form of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) that involves 20 seconds of maximum effort followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated for 8 rounds. Lasting just 4 minutes, Tabata is highly efficient for improving cardiovascular health, burning fat, and boosting metabolism in a short amount of time, making it popular for those with tight schedules.
* CrossFit (混合健身) is a high-intensity fitness program that combines elements of weightlifting, cardio, and bodyweight exercises to improve overall fitness. Its emphasis on constantly varied workouts makes it suitable for all fitness levels, and it’s popular for its community-driven culture and the competitive [CrossFit Games](https://games.crossfit.com) that determine the fittest athletes worldwide.
