# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Reach high, for stars lie hidden in you. Dream deep, for every dream precedes the goal.” — Rabindranath Tagore
* “As you become an adult, you realize that things around you weren’t just always there; people made them happen. But only recently have I started to internalize how much tenacity everything requires. That hotel, that park, that railway. The world is a museum of passion projects.” — John Collison (Co-founder of Stripe)
* “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.” — Carl Sagan
* “People are always looking for the single magic bullet that will completely change everything. There is no single magic bullet. Progress is about bridging the gap between what we observe and what we can imagine — one careful step at a time.” — Temple Grandin
* “Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any.” — Thomas Jefferson

# Things I Learned This Week

* [無患子 (Sapindus)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Sapindus) 是一種屬於無患子科 (Sapindaceae) 的喬木或灌木植物。它的果實通常被稱為「皂果」或「肥皂果」，因為果皮富含天然皂素 （Saponin），可用作對環境友善的環保清潔劑。
* 腰子：指動物的腎臟
* [Odysee](https://odysee.com/) is an American decentralized video hosting platform built on the LBRY blockchain. It positions itself as an alternative to mainstream services like YouTube.
* Brain Fart ≈ Senior Moment ≈ 暫時性腦缺血發作 (Transient Ischemic Attack = TIA = Mini Stroke)
* The term “Sherlocked” is widely used in the tech industry to describe a situation where Apple or another company introduces (duplicates) a feature that makes third-party applications or services obsolete. It originates from the 1990s when Apple introduced a desktop search tool called Sherlock, an enhancement to the Mac OS “Find” feature, which allowed users to search both their local files and the web from a single interface. Named after the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, the tool was designed to help users “find” things. Sherlock competed with a more advanced desktop search program called Watson in 2001, and was replaced by Spotlight, a faster, and more integrated, modern solution, in 2005. Another example is the introduction of the Night Shift feature in 2016, which made third-party apps like [F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) unnecessary. This demonstrated how Apple often adds features that replace projects developed by others.
