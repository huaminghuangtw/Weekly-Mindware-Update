# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* If you spend your time chasing butterflies, they’ll fly away. But if you spend your time making a beautiful garden, the butterflies will come. — Don’t chase, attract.
* “Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.” ― Epicurus
* Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.
* Brick walls are not there to stop us from getting something, they are there to check how badly we want something.
* A ship in harbor is safe — but that is not what ships are built for.

# Things I Learned This Week

* About career: 裸辭、查勤、轉職衝擊 (Shift Shock)、PIP (= Performance Improvement Plan)、安靜離職 (Quiet Quitting) → 並不是真的辭掉工作，而是放棄在工作上鞠躬盡瘁、砥礪精進，只做好自己份內的職責 (躺平族)。
* IMHO = In My Humble Opinion
* Optimus, also known as Tesla Bot, is a conceptual general-purpose robotic humanoid under development by Tesla, Inc.
* Tesla Dojo is a supercomputer designed and built by Tesla for computer vision video processing and recognition. It will be used for training Tesla’s machine learning models to improve its Full Self-Driving (FSD) advanced driver-assistance system.
* 加薩走廊 (Gaza Strip)
