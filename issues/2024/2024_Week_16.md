# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Every time you do something that is one less time you could do it — cherish every moment of your life like it is your last — because it very well might be.
* “The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.” — Socrates
* We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves strong — the amount of work is the same.
* Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure.
* If you don’t like where you are, move. You’re not a f*king tree!

# Things I Learned This Week

* Gelato (義式冰淇淋) is lower in fat (compared to 美式冰淇淋) because it contains less cream and more milk, and is churned slower resulting in less air and a richer flavour (as well as denser texture 口感更綿密).
* Hijab (阿拉伯頭巾) is a head covering worn in public by some Muslim women.
* Time Bank (時間銀行) uses units of time as currency.
* Tyre Pressure: 1 BAR (metric unit) ≈ 14.50 PSI (imperial unit)
* Chamois/Shammy Towel 仿麂皮毛巾 (有很好的吸水性，常用於汽車美容)
