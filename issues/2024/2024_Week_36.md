# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [When people talk about traveling to the past, they worry about radically changing the present by doing something small, but barely anyone in the present really thinks that they can radically change the future by doing something small.](https://x.com/ShwrThght/status/980669153685180416)
* [“At some point, everything is going to go south on you...and you're gonna say 'this is it, this is how I end.' Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work. That's all it is, you just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem. Then you solve the next one. And the next. And if you solve enough problems, you get to come home.” — _The Martian_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDYCLFE86Po)
* [Life is not a debate—it's not about winning the argument or being right.](https://tim.blog/2018/08/02/ann-miura-ko/) Winning an argument doesn’t make you right. Someone might win an argument and still be wrong. Being good at debating is not the same as being right.
* The most interesting, valuable opportunities in life are inherently unpredictable. They are non-linear, asymmetric—you cannot plan for them. They don’t follow the predetermined path.
* [“The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.” ― William Shakespeare](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/71-the-fool-doth-think-he-is-wise-but-the-wise)
