# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Don’t confuse DISAGREEMENT with DISRESPECT. Never confuse your CRITICS with your HATERS. Feedback can skyrocket your growth _if you don’t take it personally_.
* If something is wrong, fix it now, but train yourself not to worry. Worry is wasted. Worry fixes nothing.
* Your job, throughout your entire life, is to disappoint as many people as it takes to avoid disappointing yourself.
* “Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.” — Mark Twain
* You may not control the outcome, but you can influence it.
