# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “You don’t become what you want, you become what you believe.” — Oprah Winfrey
* A change in worldview will change the world viewed. We see the world not as it is, but as we are.
* “We do not have a fear of the unknown. What we fear is giving up the known.” — Anthony de Mello
* “Never lose. I either win or learn.” — Nelson Mandela
* “To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. Every man is tasked to make his life, even in its details, worthy of the contemplation of his most elevated and critical hour.” ― Henry David Thoreau

# Things I Learned This Week

* 氣泡紙 (Bubble Wrap/Paper/Bag)
* 打水漂: Stone skipping and stone skimming are the arts of throwing a flat stone across water in such a way (usually sidearm) that it bounces off the surface. “Skipping” counts the number of bounces; “skimming” measures the distance traveled.
* Near-Field Communication (NFC)
* Shimano Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) for E-bikes
* 柏林 \> 漢堡 \> 慕尼黑 \> 科隆 \> 法蘭克福 \> 斯圖加特 \> 杜賽道夫
