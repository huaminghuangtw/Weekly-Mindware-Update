# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
* We often believe that we can’t afford the time it takes to learn (“I don’t have time.”), but the opposite is true: None of us can afford the consequence of not to learn.
* “I never once in my life ever said I wanted to be the best of all time. Ever. I wanted to be the best I could be, period. It didn’t matter what the other guys were doing. It mattered what I was doing.” — Tom Brady
* The grass isn’t greener on the other side. The grass is greenest where you water it.
* Bored people are boring.
