# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Don’t confuse DISAGREEMENT with DISRESPECT. Never confuse your CRITICS with your HATERS. Feedback can skyrocket your growth _if you don’t take it personally_.
* If something is wrong, fix it now, but train yourself not to worry. Worry is wasted. Worry fixes nothing.

* “Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.” — Mark Twain
