# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* No problems, no progress.
* A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
* Forget Utopia. Ignore Dystopia. Embrace Protopia — a world in which things are a little bit better.
* Balance is not something you find, it's something you create.
* Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think. Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink. The years go by, as quickly as a wink.

# Things I Learned This Week

* Visual Programming is an intuitive way of creating software applications without writing code. It's a graphical representation of how different components interact, allowing developers to create complex programs quickly and easily. (↔ _Spatial Computing_)
* The Apple Vision Pro headset is incorporated with its newly-developed visionOS software, which lets you operate the gadget using just your eyes, hand gestures and voice command. This headset uses spatial computing to incorporate virtual reality in your real surroundings.
* A geofence is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area.
* Wordle is a web-based word game - players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.
