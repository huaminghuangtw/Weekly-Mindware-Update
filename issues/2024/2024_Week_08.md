# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Every single thing you do today is something that your 90-year-old self would wish they could go back and do. The good old days are happening right now.
* Wanna go fast? Go slow. Rushing causes errors. Errors cause setbacks. Setbacks cause delays. — Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
* Think in decades. Act in days.
* Embracing slow is the ultimate arbitrage, the ultimate edge. It allows you to think in decades while the world thinks in days and weeks.
* When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.
