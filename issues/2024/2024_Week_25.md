* The [Marathon Grand Championship]([https://www.mgc42195.jp/](https://www.mgc42195.jp/)) (MGC，日本馬拉松奧運選拔賽) is Japan’s official Olympic marathon trials, created by the [Japan Association of Athletics Federations]([https://www.jaaf.or.jp/english/](https://www.jaaf.or.jp/english/)) (JAAF，日本陸上競技聯盟) to select national representatives. In this decisive race, athletes who qualify through strict time standards in designated Japanese marathons compete for Olympic spots, with the **top two finishers** directly earning selection to the Olympic marathon team. Since its launch in 2019, the **MGC** has become the core of Japan’s marathon selection process, later expanding into the **MGC Series**, a nationwide points-based circuit used to determine who may enter future MGC races and to select athletes for other international events.
