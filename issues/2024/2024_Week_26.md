# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Chaos is our default state. Embrace the chaos. Act in the middle of chaos.
* [If you feel resistance before you begin, it's usually procrastination and you need to get started. If you feel resistance after you begin, it's usually feedback and you need to make adjustments.](https://jamesclear.com/quotes/if-you-feel-resistance-before-you-begin-its-usually-procrastination-and-you-need-to-get-started)
* [If you want to play at a higher level, you need to be comfortable with greater swings of highs and lows: mentally, emotionally, financially.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/october-12-2023)
