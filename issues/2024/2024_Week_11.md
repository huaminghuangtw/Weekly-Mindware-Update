# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Try not to become a person of success, but rather try to become a person of value.
* You can’t read the label from inside the bottle. Sometimes it takes outside eyes to help you see where you are. When in doubt, zoom out.
* Knowing means nothing without decisive actions.
* If you slow down, you’ll speed up.
* If you are not growing, you are dying.

# Things I Learned This Week

* Master of Fine Arts (MFA)
* 奧地利 Manner 威化餅
* OLED = Organic Light-Emitting Diode = 有機發光二極體
* The most significant difference between **e-paper** and **LCD** is that e-paper displays are based on electronic ink technology, while LCD displays are based on liquid crystals. Another major difference is that e-paper displays consumes very less power than LCD displays.
* 北海道 = Hokkaido
