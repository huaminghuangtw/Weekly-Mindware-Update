# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Glory is fleeting, but obscurity is forever.” — Napoleon Bonaparte
* “You do a lot of meaningless, purposeless, stupid things. You get obsessed. You spend years focused on it. And literally, no one cares but you. But you persevere anyway and you keep running. Because when you add up all those stupid, meaningless obsessions, what they add up to is your life.” — Casey Neistat
* [「願上帝賜予我平靜，去接受我所不能改變的；願上帝賜予我勇氣，去改變我所能夠改變的；願上帝賜予我智慧，去分辨兩者間的差異。」— 寧靜禱文](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer)
* Fix hardware (physiology, the body) before software (psychology, the brain).
* Curiosity is the beginning of knowledge. Action is the beginning of change.
