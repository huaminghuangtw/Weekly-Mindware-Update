# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant.” — Robert Louis Stevenson
* [“Don't ever let someone tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you got to protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you (that) you can't do it. You want something, go get it. Period.” — The Pursuit of Happyness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZb2NOHPA2A&ab_channel=Movieclips)
* “There are many men of principle in both parties in America, but there is no party of principle.” ― Alexis de Tocqueville
* [What can we remove? Remember those who did the invisible work of removing. Their legacy was not to build a sand castle, but to care for the beautiful beach on which we play.](https://stephango.com/remove)
* “If there is no wind, row.”

# Things I Learned This Week

* ISPO Munich is world’s largest sports equipment trade show.
* Disc Golf = Frisbee Golf = 飛盤高爾夫
* 零歐元紙鈔 (0-Euro-Schein): 並非經由國家層級的銀行印製，而是由獲得歐洲央行批准的印刷公司進行印製\&發行。具備一些典型紙鈔的安全特徵，為了避免混淆，紙鈔選擇少見的紫色。
* 南韓松島國際都市 (Songdo International Business District) 為填海造陸而成的人工島新興都市
* Martial Arts 武術: 功夫、柔道、空手道、跆拳道 etc.
