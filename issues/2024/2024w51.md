# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [“Sometimes you put walls up not to keep people out, but to see who cares enough to break them down.” ― Socrates](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/389916-sometimes-you-put-walls-up-not-to-keep-people-out)
* “When you love someone, you have to offer that person the best you have. The best thing we can offer another person is our true presence (full attention).” — Thích Nhất Hạnh
* “The main affliction of our modern civilization is that we don’t know how to handle the suffering inside us and we try to cover it up with all kinds of consumption.” — Thích Nhất Hạnh
* “My central claim in this book is that these two trends—overprotection in the real world and underprotection in the virtual world—are the major reasons why children born after 1995 became the anxious generation.” ― Jonathan Haidt, The Anxious Generation
* “As the Stoics and Buddhists taught long ago, happiness cannot be reached by eliminating all “triggers” from life; rather, happiness comes from learning to deprive external events of the power to trigger negative emotions in you.” — Jonathan Haidt, The Anxious Generation
