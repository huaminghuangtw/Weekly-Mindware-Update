# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.” — Thomas Jefferson
* Do not mistake a “confident explanation” for an “accurate prediction” — a lot of what you hear can be summarized as: confident, but inaccurate.
* “One of life’s counterintuitive lessons is that you will often gain energy by spending a little bit of energy — If you want to get your day going, then get your body going. It’s harder for the mind to be sluggish when the body is moving.”
* You never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from.
* “The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them.” — Mark Twain → Ability is nothing without action.
