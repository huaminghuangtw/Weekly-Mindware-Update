# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Be like a postage stamp. Stick to it until you get there.” — Bob Proctor → Rest in the end, not in the middle.
* [You have to be willing to explore widely enough to find your thing, then willing to focus narrowly enough to make it something great.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/october-10-2024)
* “My dad could have been a great comedian, but he didn’t think that was possible for him. Instead of following his passion, he made a conservative decision and landed a secure job as an accountant. However, when I was 12, he was laid off from that safe job, and our family had to do everything they could to survive. That experience taught me something profound: _even if you play it safe, you can fail. You can fail at something you don’t like. So why not take a chance on what you really love? That’s what I learned from my father. It’s not just about what life can offer, it’s about what you’re willing to pursue, without fear of failure. Because the biggest risk is not trying._” — Jim Carrey
* [The ultimate success metric is whether you get what you want out of life. But that’s harder than it sounds because it’s easy to try to copy someone who wants something you don’t.](https://collabfund.com/blog/your-way-is-the-only-way/)
* “Good is the enemy of great. Few people attain great lives, in large part because it is just so easy to settle for a good life.” — Jim Collins, [Good to Great](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1094028)

# Things I Learned This Week

* 雪酪 (Sherbet or Sorbet): (1) 製法是將新鮮水果冷凍至結冰後磨成冰沙 (2) **Sherbet** contains a small amount of dairy, while **sorbet** is entirely dairy-free.
* 克菲爾 (Kefir) 有點像優格，但比優格更濃稠，口感也更綿密，最早起源於北高加索山區 (Caucasus Mountains)
* Anti-Perspirant (止汗劑) stops the sweating by using aluminum to help block the pores, which is bad for your health. ↔ Deodorant (體香劑) is just for smell and you’ll still sweat.
* Voting/Electoral System: (1) First Past the Post (FPTP): voters cast a vote for a single candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins the election. → single winner (2) Block Voting (BV): voters may cast as many votes as the number of seats to be filled. → multiple winners
* Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants (抗抑鬱劑)
