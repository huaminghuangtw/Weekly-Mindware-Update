# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* [Exploration is how you discover what works. Persistence is how you make the most of what already works.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/september-12-2024)
* “We all are learning, modifying, or destroying ideas all the time. Rapid destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable qualities you can acquire. You must force yourself to consider arguments on the other side. You have to work hard on it. Ask yourself what are the arguments on the other side. It’s bad to have an opinion unless you can state the other side’s arguments / argue against yourself better than they can. This is a great mental discipline.” — Charlie Munger
* [If you have a strong informed opinion, don't keep it to yourself. Try to help people and make the world a better place. _It doesn't matter how many people don't get it. What matters is how many people do it._](https://tim.blog/2008/12/31/things-ive-learned-and-loved-in-2008/)
* The sum of our life’s decisions equate to the person we are on our deathbed.
* “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.” — Mark Twain

# Things I Learned This Week

* 為什麼汪星人喜歡在柱狀物 (消防栓和電線桿) 上尿尿? 狗狗是通過尿尿來留下自己的氣味、佔地盤、標明自己的身份和地位的 (尿液標記 or 打尿標)。而獨立的柱狀物可以標記的面積最大，最容易表現自己。
