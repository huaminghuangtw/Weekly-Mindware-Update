# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice.
* Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.
* “If you accomplish something good with hard work, the labor passes quickly, but the good endures; if you do something shameful in pursuit of pleasure, the pleasure passes quickly, but the shame endures.” ― Musonius Rufus
* Forget about all the reasons why something may not work. You only need to find one good reason why it will.
* Slow progress is better than no progress. Not making progress is still better than moving backwards.
