# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* People can’t read your thoughts. If you think something, say something. Don’t expect people to guess your thoughts and feelings. Don’t hold a grudge when people didn’t predict what you wanted them to do. Just tell them.
* “He who blames others has a long way to go on his journey. He who blames himself is halfway there. He who blames no one has arrived.” (怨人者途遠，責己者行半，無戾者已至，此之謂也。)
* Self-actualization → Self-transcendence
* Never let success get to your head. Never let failure get to your heart.
* Don’t find fault. Find a remedy.

# Things I Learned This Week

* Vitamalz is a German malt beer (麥芽啤酒) without alcohol.
* A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** is a web application that delivers an app-like experience through a browser, combining the best features of web and mobile apps. It **feels like a native mobile or desktop app**, but it’s still just a website under the hood. Built with standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, PWAs are fast, responsive, installable, work offline, send push notifications, and are always served over HTTPS for security. They are designed to work on any device and improve progressively based on browser capabilities, offering users a native app feel without needing an app store.
* “Steinway \& Sons” for Piano (平台式/直立式鋼琴)
* Cross-Country Skiing 越野滑雪
* 衝鋒衣外套
