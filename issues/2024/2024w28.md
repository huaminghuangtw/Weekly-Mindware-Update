# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

That is to me the sign of a champion. _The best in the world are not the best because they win every point. It’s because they know they will lose again and again, and have learnt how to deal with it._ You accept it, cry it out if you need to, and then force a smile.” — Roger Federer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqWUuYTcG-o&t=890s)
* “A man is what he thinks about all day long.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson
* “May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.” — Nelson Mandela → From “The Thing I Want To Do” to “Actually Doing It”
* “Go ahead, let them judge you.”

# Things I Learned This Week

* [Emoji Shortcodes](https://emojipedia.org/shortcodes) are codes used on various websites to speed up emoji insertion using a keyboard (might vary from platform/application to platform/application; two major uses of these codes are on [Github](https://emojipedia.org/github/) or [Slack](https://emojipedia.org/slack/)). They begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji. For example, `:joy:` shows 😂.
