# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “If you set your goals ridiculously high and it’s a failure, you will fail above everyone else’s success.” — James Cameron
* “The positive thinker sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible.” — Winston Churchill
* “Never give up on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.” — Earl Nightingale
* “Progress lies not in enhancing what is, but in advancing toward what will be.” — Khalil Gibran
* [“You should be very thoughtful and realize in most things (relationships, work, even in learning) what you're trying to do is find the thing you can go all-in on to earn compound interest. When you're dating, the instant you know this relationship is not going to be the one that leads to marriage, you should probably move on. When you're studying something, like a geography or history class, and you realize you are never going to use the information, drop the class. It’s a waste of time. It’s a waste of your brain energy. I'm not saying don't do the 99 percent, because it’s very hard to identify what the 1 percent is. What I'm saying is: when you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted; which you'll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you, go all-in and forget about the rest.” — _Almanack of Naval Ravikant_](https://www.navalmanack.com/)
