# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “It doesn’t matter where you are, you are nowhere compared to where you can go.” — Bob Proctor
* “There is no failure except in no longer trying. There is no defeat except from within, no insurmountable barrier except our own inherent weakness of purpose.” — Elbert Hubbard
* [Focus on what provides value to others, not what impresses others. — The things we do to impress others rarely impress them for longer than five minutes. But the things we do to provide value for others can last a lifetime. In the long run, one of the most impressive things you can do is provide exceptional value.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/october-31-2024)
* “Facts are the enemy of truth.” — Miguel de Cervantes
* “Adversity is the tempering of one’s mettle. Without it, we cannot know any true meaning in our accomplishments.” — Ming-Dao Deng

# Things I Learned This Week

* [條漫 (Webtoon)](https://www.webtoons.com/) 一詞是由「網路 (Web) 」和「卡通 (Cartoon)」兩字組合而成，最早於 1990 年代後期出現在韓國。有別於傳統的紙本印刷漫畫: 1) 條漫通常是由獨立漫畫家專為網路創作的作品，完全以數位的形式發行，沒有實體紙本 2) 條漫由直條狀畫面所構成，讀者可以由上至下直向捲動 (而非橫向翻頁)，很適合在智慧型手機上閱讀 3) 條漫是彩色的而非黑白的
* PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) study/score is a worldwide study intended to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils’ scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.
* Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish and English.
* Telugu is one of the six languages designated as a classical language by the Government of India, primarily spoken in south-eastern India.
* [Montana](https://www.google.com/maps?q=Montana) 蒙大拿州: (1) 有「北美大陸皇冠」之稱的冰河國家公園 (2) 美國最廣大的純淨原始地區與野生生態區之一
