# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “A man is what he thinks about all day long.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson

* “Go ahead, let them judge you.”

# Things I Learned This Week

* [Emoji Shortcodes](https://emojipedia.org/shortcodes) are codes used on various websites to speed up emoji insertion using a keyboard (might vary from platform/application to platform/application; two major uses of these codes are on [Github](https://emojipedia.org/github/) or [Slack](https://emojipedia.org/slack/)). They begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji. For example, `:joy:` shows 😂.
