# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Your life doesn't get better by chance, it gets better by change.
* The decent method you follow is better than the perfect method you quit.
* Being upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have. Never let the things you want make you forget the things you have.
* The only way to find your true capability is to push yourself out of your comfort zone.
* Don't let yesterday take up too much of today.
