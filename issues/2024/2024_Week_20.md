# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Don't be pushed by your problems. Be led by your dreams.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson
* It is easier to act yourself into a new way of thinking, than it is to think yourself into a new way of acting.
* We do not learn from experience. We learn from _reflecting_ on experience.
* “To get what you want, you have to _deserve_ what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people.” ― Charlie Munger
* Most people focus too much on being interesting and not enough on being interested. Being interested is how you become interesting.
