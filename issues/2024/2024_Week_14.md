# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.” → It's a short reminder that success can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations we are willing to have, and by the number of uncomfortable actions we are willing to take.
* Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal.
* Do not try to be the man your father would want you to be. Be the man you would like your son to be.
* “Obstacle is the way. Ego is the enemy. Stillness is the key.” — Ryan Holiday
* “A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.” ― George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones
