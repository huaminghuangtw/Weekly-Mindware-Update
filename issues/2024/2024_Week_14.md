# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.” → It’s a short reminder that success can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations we are willing to have, and by the number of uncomfortable actions we are willing to take.
* Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal.
* Do not try to be the man your father would want you to be. Be the man you would like your son to be.
* “Obstacle is the way. Ego is the enemy. Stillness is the key.” — Ryan Holiday
* “A lion doesn’t concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.” ― George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones

# Things I Learned This Week

* Charcuterie (法文) Board = 熟食冷肉盤
* **[Fine Print（細則條款／小字條款）]([https://www.google.com/search?q=Fine+Print](https://www.google.com/search?q=Fine+Print))** refers to the small text in a contract containing terms, conditions, or disclosures not included in the main body. Often printed in footnotes or supplementary sections, it may hide important limitations or obligations. **[Boilerplate Clauses（標準條款）]([https://www.google.com/search?q=Boilerplate+Clauses](https://www.google.com/search?q=Boilerplate+Clauses))** refers to standardized provision placed at the end of contracts, covering aspects like governing law or dispute resolution. While _fine print_ hides specifics, _boilerplate clauses_ define the legal framework — both reminding us to read every part of a contract carefully.
* Broscience is a term for misinformation circulated among men, usually body-building claims not backed by science.
* 男丁女口
* Intro ↔ Outro
