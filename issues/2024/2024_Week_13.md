# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.
* If you live for people’s approval, you will die from their rejection.
* You don’t have to be alone (physical state) to feel lonely (emotional state).
* Most people quit because they look how far they have to go, not how far they have come.
* You are always just one good decision away from being in a better place tomorrow — just focus on the next decision.
