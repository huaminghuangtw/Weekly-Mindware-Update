# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “Love yourself with the same intensity you would use to pull yourself up if you were hanging off a cliff.” — Kamal Ravikant
* “Focus on the basics. Get the basics right. Approximately 95% of your results will come from the basic-level foundation.” — Arnold Schwarzenegger
* There is nothing more comfortable than sitting on the couch watching some great TV. But nobody ever changed their life or changed the world from their couch.
* To live is to learn. I see no other option.
* The things you want in life will come to you, but only when you are ready for them.
