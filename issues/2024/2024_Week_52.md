# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “In my 35 years of studying moral psychology, I have come to see this as one of humanity’s greatest problems: we are too quick to anger and too slow to forgive. We are also hypocrites who judge others harshly while automatically justifying our own bad behavior.” ― Jonathan Haidt, The Anxious Generation
* “People don’t get depressed when they face threats collectively; they get depressed when they feel isolated, lonely, or useless.” — Jonathan Haidt, The Anxious Generation

* “Nothing is good except what leads to fairness, self-control, courage, and free will. And nothing bad except what does the opposite.” — Marcus Aurelius
* “Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.” — Oscar Wilde
