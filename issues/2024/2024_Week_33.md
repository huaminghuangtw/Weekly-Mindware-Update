# Wisdom I Pondered This Week

* “We are not going in circles, we are going upwards. The path is a [spiral](https://sketchplanations.com/the-upward-spiral); we have already climbed many steps.” — Hermann Hesse
* [Style is consistent constraint. Having a style collapses hundreds of future decisions into one, and gives you focus. Style gives you leverage. Every time you reuse your style you save time. A durable style is a great investment. Collect constraints you enjoy.](https://stephango.com/style)
* “Pay close attention to people who don't clap when you win.” — Leonardo DiCaprio → Invest in people who invest in you. Life is too short to waste your time on people who don't respect, appreciate, and value you.
* “There are no strangers here; Only friends you haven't yet met.” — William Butler Yeats
* [“Pick one thing and spend the rest of your life getting deeper into it. Mastery is the best goal because the rich can’t buy it, the impatient can’t rush it, the privileged can’t inherit it, and nobody can steal it. You can only earn it through hard work. Mastery is the ultimate status.” — _HOW TO LIVE_ by Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/h)
