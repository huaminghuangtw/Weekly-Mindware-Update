# Weekly Mindware Update

> _“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.” — Stephen Hawking_

## About

This repository is a weekly dump of ten ideas that spark my curiosity and expand my mind. The sources are diverse, often captured while I’m [reading](https://github.com/huaminghuangtw/Brain-Food) or having a conversation with people.

## Why I Built This Project

> _“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” — Mark Twain_

> _“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.” — Richard Feynman_

I used to be arrogant, thinking I had the world figured out. A fool’s confidence. An [intellectual yet idiot](https://huami.ng/the-intellectual-yet-idiot).

The more I learn, the more I realize that most of my certainties were [totally wrong and deluded](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/). I’ve learned the hard way that, to learn is to be willing to let go of your ego.

So I started this project.

A weekly ritual to practice my humility.

Ten ideas to keep my mind open. To be aware of my ignorance. To admit that I don’t have all the answers.

And a change began.

I learned to [lower my identity](https://paulgraham.com/identity.html), to [assume people were smarter than me](https://sive.rs/below-average), and to enjoy feeling like a beginner.

> _“Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.” — Richard Feynman_

I believe that, staying curious is the only way to get closer to the frontier of **[unknown unknowns](https://sketchplanations.com/unknown-unknowns)—what we don’t know we don’t know**.

This project is a reminder to myself.

To always be humble.

To always learn with the eyes of a child.

To always be a student, as if to live forever.
